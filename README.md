# Energy-Failure-Risk-Predictor-2005-2020-
This project analyzes global energy and sustainability data to identify countries at high risk of future energy system stress or failure. A composite Energy Failure Risk Score was developed using indicators such as fossil fuel dependency, renewable energy penetration, energy intensity, electricity access, and per-capita energy consumption.
