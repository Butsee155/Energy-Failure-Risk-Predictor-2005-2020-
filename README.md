📌 Project Title

Energy Failure Risk Predictor (2005–2020)
A Data Analytics & Visualization Project using Global Sustainable Energy Data

📄 Project Description

This project analyzes global energy and sustainability data to identify countries at high risk of future energy system stress or failure.
A composite Energy Failure Risk Score was developed using indicators such as fossil fuel dependency, renewable energy penetration, energy intensity, electricity access, and per-capita energy consumption.

The final output includes a Power BI interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to explore risk patterns across countries and over time.

🎯 Business Objective

To help policymakers, energy planners, and analysts:

Identify high-risk regions

Understand key drivers of energy system stress

Support data-driven energy transition decisions

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Power BI

Excel / CSV

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Features

Risk trend over time

Top high-risk countries

Dynamic slicers

📈 Key Insights

Countries with high fossil fuel dependency show consistently higher risk

Renewable energy penetration significantly reduces failure risk

High energy intensity is a strong indicator of system inefficiency and stress

💡 Recommendations

Increase renewable electricity capacity

Improve energy efficiency to reduce intensity

Diversify national energy sources to mitigate risk
